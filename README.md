A simple OAuth2 serverless gateway for Netlify CMS written in TypeScript.

# Why do I need this?

If you would like to use Netlify CMS to manage your site deployed to Vercel.

[GitHub](https://github.com) and [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com) requires a server for authentication and Netlify provides this server only for sites deployed to it. Fortunately, such server is rather small and can work with Vercel's serverless functions.

# Usage

In yours projects modify `config.yml` file:

```yaml
backend:
  name: [github | gitlab]
  repo: toddainsworth/toddainsworth-site # Path to your Github/Gitlab repository
  branch: main # Branch to update
  base_url: https://netlify-cms.toddainsworth.vercel.app
```
